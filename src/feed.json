I brought up the fact that an investigation was never done. I received an email asking for photos of the packaging to “aid them” and literally 7 minutes later before I could even reply received an email saying their investigation was complete and would be unable to provide a replacement/refund. I went to the store in person where I was told all they could do was “expedite my ticket” after scribbling my info on some paper because Best Buy and BestBuy.com are treated as two separate entities. I filed a chargeback claim, which I have since cancelled. I filed a police report, shout out to the officer for being the only one who seemed to genuinely want to help me as a fellow PC gamer! Lastly, I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, and someone FINALLY reached out to me on 12/12.</p> <p>After reviewing the evidence I managed to compile like the weight change where the package gained nearly 3lbs in transit with FedEx and lack of protective/concealing packaging on Best Buy’s end, and I guess their own proper investigation they gave me a refund. Obviously that was a win, but now that card was no longer on sale and I don’t have the extra $300-$400 to shell out, especially with the holidays around the corner. So I brought that up and the representative who assisted me price matched my original purchase AND set it up to be shipped to my local store and I finally received my 5080 on 12/16.</p> <p>Again, thank you to everyone who gave me advice on how to deal with such a bizarre situation, you guys are great!

So I brought that up and the representative who assisted me price matched my original purchase AND set it up to be shipped to my local store and I finally received my 5080 on 12/16.\n Again, thank you to everyone who gave me advice on how to deal with such a bizarre situation, you guys are great! As a bonus, my girlfriend tattooed a fun gap-filler on my leg to commemorate such a ridiculous event in the last image. Im sure one day I’ll stop hearing “I bet it’s rocks again” whenever I tell my friends I ordered something.\n    submitted by    /u/GnarDead    to    r/pcmasterrace  \n [link]   [comments]","id":"t3_1pznc8u","isoDate":"2025-12-30T17:00:01.000Z"},{"title":"Meirl","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/meirl/comments/1pzrgqk/meirl/","pubDate":"2025-12-30T19:34:59.000Z","author":"/u/Key_Associate7476","content":"<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/meirl/comments/1pzrgqk/meirl/\"> <img src=\"https://preview.redd.it/gfij5w4u8eag1.jpeg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a35da43baaea2e8b5b680f770a5ef056b753979a\" alt=\"Meirl\" title=\"Meirl\" /> </a> </td><td> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Key_Associate7476\"> /u/Key_Associate7476 </a> &#32; to &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/meirl/\"> r/meirl </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/gfij5w4u8eag1.jpeg\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/meirl/comments/1pzrgqk/meirl/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>","contentSnippet":"submitted by    /u/Key_Associate7476    to    r/meirl  \n [link]   [comments]","id":"t3_1pzrgqk","isoDate":"2025-12-30T19:34:59.000Z"},{"title":"Last photo of Muhammad Ali (2016)","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/1pzydsk/last_photo_of_muhammad_ali_2016/","pubDate":"2025-12-31T00:18:12.000Z","author":"/u/AugustHate","content":"<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/1pzydsk/last_photo_of_muhammad_ali_2016/\"> <img src=\"https://preview.redd.it/8uoszrzcnfag1.jpeg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92c507f141c038c7770e85efae1e46f446878415\" alt=\"Last photo of Muhammad Ali (2016)\" title=\"Last photo of Muhammad Ali (2016)\" /> </a> </td><td> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AugustHate\"> /u/AugustHate </a> &#32; to &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/\"> r/interestingasfuck </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/8uoszrzcnfag1.jpeg\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/1pzydsk/last_photo_of_muhammad_ali_2016/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>","contentSnippet":"submitted by    /u/AugustHate    to    r/interestingasfuck  \n [link]   [comments]","id":"t3_1pzydsk","isoDate":"2025-12-31T00:18:12.000Z"}]
