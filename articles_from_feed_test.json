Remembering people for the wonderful lives they had and lived, the time I had with them before they passed. I cherish it. That’s what losing someone is like. Most people feed so much on the end result, the messy break-up, the hate for someone who was once important to you, the bridge of friendship burning as bright as the sun. But important are the times before that, the times when you valued another human life with more conviction than your own self.\nIt’s a beautiful thing.\nBest\nMovie watched this year: Close Your Eyes, 2023 (that’s where this article’s cover image is taken from, Ana Torrent and José Coronado).\nMovie released this year: nothing.\nMusic album listened this year: Luck and Strange by David Gilmour.\nSong of the year: nothing.\nBook read this year: The New Demons, by Jacques Ellul.\nVideo game played this year: Minecraft.\nWorst\nEverything else.\nMost listened songs\nI’ll let iTunes.app speak for itself:\nArtist\nTitle\nPlays\n\n\n\n\nDavid Gilmour\nScattered\n931\n\n\nLinkin Park\nLeave Out All the Rest\n902\n\n\nPapa Roach\nCarry Me\n875\n\n\nThe Montgolfier Brothers\nJourney’s End\n677\n\n\nArchive\nAgain\n586\n\n\nAlexander Hristov & Wallmers\nLet’s Go Retro\n401\n\n\nSirotkin\nВыше домов\n391\n\n\nLinkin Park\nJornada Del Muerto\n364\n\n\nTwenty One Pilots\nCar Radio\n290\n\n\nPorter\nCuervos\n285\n\n\n\nMovies watched\nI watched 98 movies this year, the oldest was The Great Dictator, 1940, by Charles Chaplin, and the newest was Close Your Eyes, 2023, by Victor Erice.\nFrom my current list of 198 favorite movies, 10 of them were watched or re-watched this year.\nWebsite\n34 articles, 52,185 words worth, down from 42 articles and 38,195 words in 2024.\nused 2,6GB of disk space, up from 1,33GB in 2024.\nmore website statistics.\nOthers\nI’ve stopped using modern computers and phones, most of the computing time is spent on a 2004 iMac G5, a 2005 iBook G4 and I use a Nokia 808 as my only phone.\nI launched the Café, a small private and invite-only community for people to share their thoughts, ideas and experiences.\nPlans for next year\nSpend at least 70% less time online.\nDownsize.\nIt’s getting to me, all the anger, all the envy, all the resentment. I open a web browser and 90% of content I see is just self-victimisation and despair. No one has a positive vision of the Future, no one is happy with the Present and no one respects the Past. I value compassion and modesty but it’s hard not to be influenced by the vitriol that I’m exposed to every day, it just makes me so unhappy.\nMost people today are relentless in complaining about the world and hating other groups of people, but couldn’t ever offer you a better system or way of life that remedies our problems today. They feel valid for complaining and whining all the time.","guid":"http://sizeof.cat/post/2025-in-review/","categories":["website"],"isoDate":"2025-11-21T14:23:01.000Z"},{"creator":"","title":"Quake 2 Thunderdome - this time in video","link":"http://sizeof.cat/post/quake-2-thunderdome-in-video/","pubDate":"Fri, 31 Oct 2025 23:12:51 +0000","author":"","content":"<div class=\"cover\">\n<video controls preload=\"none\" poster=\"/post/quake-2-thunderdome-in-video/img/quake.jpg\">\n<source src=\"http://sizeof.cat/post/quake-2-thunderdome-in-video/video/quake.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.64001F, mp4a.40.2&quot;\" label=\"hd720\" selected=\"true\">\n<source src=\"http://sizeof.cat/post/quake-2-thunderdome-in-video/video/quake.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.64001F, mp4a.40.2&quot;\" hidequalityoption=\"true\">\n<source src=\"http://sizeof.cat/post/quake-2-thunderdome-in-video/video/quake.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.42001E, mp4a.40.2&quot;\" label=\"medium\" selected=\"false\">\n<source src=\"http://sizeof.cat/post/quake-2-thunderdome-in-video/video/quake.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.42001E, mp4a.40.2&quot;\" hidequalityoption=\"true\">\n<p>Sorry, your browser doesn't support HTML5 video.

We currently have about 160 members so far, and we talk about various stuff (both on the Café and its dedicated IRC channel), <a href=\"http://sizeof.cat/post/cafe-weekend-round-1-quake2/\">we plan events</a> and do puzzles. And the latest puzzle challenge was something I named <strong>Fishy</strong> and it involved virtual fishing in the Café&rsquo;s wate&hellip; API for clues and secrets. The reward is a unique member title (<em>&lt;Master baiter&gt;</em>) for the first solver + <a href=\"http://sizeof.cat/cafe/img/badges/303.png\">a cool Café badge</a>, and a different title (<em>&lt;Fisher&gt;</em>) + the same badge for everybody who solves it after.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ll let the one and only <strong>bonk</strong> tell you how the puzzle can be solved, since he&rsquo;s the first to solve it, and therefore will be forever known in the Café annals as <em>&lt;Master baiter&gt;</em> <strong>bonk</strong> (because he baits masterfully and not for other reasons, you perverts!):</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The puzzle started by sizeofcat hinting us by saying <em>&ldquo;There might be something Fishy here, if you&rsquo;re looking for a puzzle :D&rdquo;</em> and linking us the Café badges page.\nThe first clue was the <a href=\"http://sizeof.cat/cafe/img/badges/303.png\">303th badge</a>&rsquo;s label that says: &ldquo;Fishy says L2ZpbGVzL3tiYWl0LGZpc2h5fQ==&rdquo;.<br>\nAt first glance, you can see it&rsquo;s base64. Decoding it reveals: <code>/files/{bait,fishy}</code>.<br>\nIn bash and many other Unix(-like) shells that would expand to: <code>/files/bait /files/fishy</code>.

Well, today I decided to do another try and dig the old archives some more.

So, I opened <code>HuaweiDataCardACMData.kext/Contents/Info.plist</code> and I added the three interface definitions for the E3131 modem, PCui interface and diagnostic interface. <a
